# Public-Software-Resources Procedures

These instructions are for maintainers (Train Control Systems).

## Adding firmware files
- Clone this repo and Depot.
- Use FirmwareRepoManager.py in Depot.
  - Use naming conventions (See documentation in Google Drive): This is *required* so that Depot can match the firmware with the product.
